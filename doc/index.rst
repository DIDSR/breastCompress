breastCompress Documentation
============================

Welcome to the VICTRE breastCompress software documentation!

This documentation provides information regarding how to download, install, and use the VICTRE breastCompress software which models the physical compression
that breasts undergo during mammographic imaging using a finite-element based linear elasticity solid mechanics simulation.  It is designed to be used with
anthropomorphic voxelized whole-breast phantoms generated by the VICTRE breast phantom software.
